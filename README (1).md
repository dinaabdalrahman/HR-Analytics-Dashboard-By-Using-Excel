## Recommendations


- The problem of leaving work can be said to be due to the increase in overtime hours, which consequently reduces performance. The solution is for me to reduce the working hours, which in turn reduces the idea of ​​leaving work.

- The problem of employee absence during working hours is greater than those present. The solution is for me to set an example for each task in relation to this employer, and thus I will reduce absences because employees tend to be present due to this work.

- Those who leave work also return to the fact that there is no promotion or there is a minority for promotion, and thus the number of employees will decrease more and more. The solution is to have a goal at work, and whoever is higher every year will be promoted based on his goal.
